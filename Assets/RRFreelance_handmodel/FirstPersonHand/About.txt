FirstPersonHand - VR Ready - RRFreelance
Version 1.0

This is the First Person Hand, more in tune with VR Design.

The Hand comes with Several poses that can be mapped to the user inputs based on 
your code. This pack currently contains no scripting but has everything else in place.
Animations can be blended between poses however you see fit.

For the opposite hand, a copy of the prefab has been made with -1 on the X-Scale.
3 materials onver 2 albedo textures have been created for skin tone variation.

A script that rotates around an objects point in the scene is included. 
Add an empty game object there and also to the slot in the script when you add it to the camera to act at the target.

Future Updates planned:More Skin Textures, Props and Poses if suggested my email.
